# Gatsby/TypeScript Portfolio Website

My porfolio website is the main collection that showcases my skills as full-stack developer. It displays my main projects and skills, a section about myself, my tech stack, my skills,education, a blog and a contact section. Built on JAMStack using TypeScript, Gatsby, GraphQL and Contentful, it uses the [JAMStack Boilerplate](https://github.com/tripheo0412/jamstack-typescript-boilerplate) by [Tri Hoang](https://github.com/tripheo0412)

The whole portfolio website is built using dynamic data coming from the headless CMS (Content Management System) Contentful, so that all content data, including titles, logos and images in the various sections can be added or updated without ever touching the code. In this case, Contentful proved to be an amazing and easy to use CMS to add content to my portfolio website.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Netlify and the demo can be found at the following link: https://michelezuccawebdev.netlify.app/
